# CVE-2019-3980

This repo was create to utilize the Nessus POC with a custom C# executable to run commands on a remote host and get the output of the command.

The python file is used to start a web server, execute the exploit, and then get the results over the web server.
The C# exe is uploaded through the exploit and when executed calls back to the IP/Port specificed to get the command to run as well as to send the output
